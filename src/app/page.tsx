              Human foods can be surprisingly calorie-dense for dogs. <br /> <br />Use this calculator to see how a portion of a human 
              food (e.g., pizza, cheese, chocolate) translates into your dog&apos;s daily calorie intake and what that would be in human terms. <br /> <br />
              This helps put "just a bite" into perspective. Choose your dog&apos;s breed, search for a human food, pick a portion 
              (bite, piece, slice, or whole item where available), and get a clear comparison.
